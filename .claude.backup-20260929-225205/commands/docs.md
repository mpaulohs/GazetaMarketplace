# /docs — Documentation

> "If it's not documented, it doesn't exist."

## Purpose

Consolidate existing documentation and complete missing pieces before deployment. Ensure all technical artifacts from previous phases are properly linked and accessible.

> **Workspace Mode:** if the session root declares `Mode: workspace` → resolve the target repo per `CLAUDE.md` §Workspace Mode **before anything else**; every path, probe, and gate below is relative to the **target repo**, and the workspace disk-check applies at the gate.

> **Principle**: Don't duplicate — link and reference existing artifacts from `/spec`, `/arch`, `/secure`, `/infra`.

> **Stack Profile note:** read `Project Profile` first. **Core = Node.js** → generate API docs from the framework's OpenAPI tooling (`@nestjs/swagger`, Fastify schema-first — see `rules/overrides/framework-nodejs-web.md`), and the `dotnet`/DocFX commands in Phase 4 & §Auto-Generation Tools map to their npm equivalents. **Core = PHP** → API docs come from the Laravel tooling (`scribe` or `l5-swagger`, or `php artisan route:list` cross-checked against `architecture/api/openapi.yaml`), not Swashbuckle/DocFX; the `dotnet` command blocks in Phase 2 (Quick Start) and Phase 6 (Deployment Guide) map to `composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader`, `php artisan migrate --force`, and `php artisan serve` / the fpm-nginx or Octane container shape from [`rules/overrides/framework-php-laravel.md`](../rules/overrides/framework-php-laravel.md) §J. The templates stay default-stack illustration — their "example only" disclaimers apply; DB/observability lines follow the Profile + `rules/overrides/*`.

## Prerequisites

- Implementation complete (`/build` done)
- Infrastructure setup (`/infra` done)
- API contracts defined (`architecture/api/`)

## Workflow

> **Run mode — first-run vs incremental.**
> - `docs/` largely absent → **first-run:** generate the full set (Phases 1-6).
> - `docs/` already exists → **incremental:** update only the docs the change touched + `CHANGELOG.md`; leave unchanged docs alone. Delta → doc map:
>   - new/changed endpoint → `docs/api/` + `CHANGELOG.md`
>   - new env var → `configuration.md`
>   - fixed bug (BUG-### in `TEST_REPORT.md`) → `troubleshooting.md`
>   - setup / run / deploy steps changed → `getting-started.md` + `deployment.md`
>   - any release → `CHANGELOG.md`
> - **When unsure whether a doc is affected → regenerate it** (don't risk staleness).
> - **Before a major release, do a full-set pass** (treat as first-run) to catch drift.

### Phase 0: Audit Existing Documentation

Before creating new docs, review what already exists from previous phases:

| Source | Check | Reuse In |
|--------|-------|----------|
| `specs/SPEC.md` | PRD, features, scope | README features section |
| `architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` | System design | `docs/architecture.md` |
| `architecture/adr/` | Decision records | Link from architecture.md |
| `architecture/api/` | API contracts | `docs/api/` |
| `docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md` (brownfield, from `/discover`) | API / module surface inventory | `docs/api/` + `docs/architecture.md` — use instead of re-reading every controller (consume-`/discover` chain) |
| `security/THREAT_MODEL.md` | Threats + STRIDE | `docs/security.md` |
| `security/SCAN_REPORT.md` | Accepted Risks + Findings (F-#) | `docs/deployment.md` Production hardening backlog |
| `reports/CODE_REVIEW.md` | Findings + carry-forward warnings | `docs/troubleshooting.md`, deployment backlog |
| `reports/TEST_REPORT.md` | Real bugs discovered (BUG-###) | `docs/troubleshooting.md` Symptom→Diagnostic→Fix entries |
| `reports/incidents/INC-*.md` (if any hotfix ran) | Real production incidents — root cause, MTTR, affected users, preventive action | `docs/troubleshooting.md` Symptom→Diagnostic→Fix entries — the highest-value entries in the file: these failures actually happened in production |
| `reports/RELEASE_NOTES_*.md` | Per-release scope + smoke results | `CHANGELOG.md` |
| `reports/DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md` | Operator procedures | Link from `docs/deployment.md` |
| `plans/todo.md` | Bug + hotfix audit trail, backlog | `docs/troubleshooting.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` |
| `docker-compose.yml` (repo root) | Service dependencies | `docs/deployment.md` |
| `docker/Dockerfile` + `docker-compose.yml` + `.env.example` | Platform/setup gotchas encoded in the build (DB image choice on arm64, Alpine globalization env, migration-on-first-run, DB volume + password) | `docs/getting-started.md` Prerequisites + `docs/troubleshooting.md` — surface the platform-specific setup steps a newcomer hits; **derive from the project's own build files, don't re-author** |
| Existing root `README.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` | Pre-existing? Framework-level? | **PRESERVE** if it serves a wider scope (monorepo / framework parent) — author product-level `docs/README.md` instead. Never blindly overwrite. |

### Phase 1: Documentation Inventory

| Document | Audience | Priority |
|----------|----------|----------|
| `docs/README.md` (documentation hub) | All audiences | Critical — navigation with explicit `Audience` column per doc |
| `README.md` (root) | All audiences | Critical (or PRESERVE if framework-level — see Phase 0) |
| Getting Started | New developer / operator | Critical |
| API Documentation | API consumer / integrator | Critical |
| Architecture | Engineer | High — one-pager; link to `architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`, don't duplicate |
| Deployment Guide | Operator | High |
| Configuration reference | Operator / contributor | High — every env var the app reads |
| Security posture | Auditor / engineer | High — summary; link to `security/`, don't duplicate |
| Troubleshooting | On-call / contributor | Medium — `Symptom → Diagnostic → Fix` entries derived from real SDLC bugs |
| Contributing | Contributor | Medium |
| Changelog | All audiences | Medium |

### Documentation Categories

| Category | Audience | Focus |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **User Docs** | End users | Features, getting started, FAQ |
| **API Docs** | API consumers | Endpoints, auth, examples |
| **Developer Docs** | Contributors | Setup, architecture, contributing |
| **Operations Docs** | DevOps/SRE | Deployment, monitoring, troubleshooting |

> **Gate 10 minimum**: README, Getting Started, API Docs, Deployment Guide

### Phase 2: README.md Template

> **Template — example only.** Replace stack, commands, and structure with the project's actual choices. If a component listed below is intentionally absent (e.g., no Kafka, no Redis), remove it rather than carry it forward as aspiration.

### Phase 3: Documentation Structure

```text
docs/
├── getting-started.md       # Quick start guide
├── architecture.md          # Links to architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md
├── CODEBASE_MAP.md          # brownfield — owned by /discover, NOT by /docs (see note below)
├── api/                     # API documentation
│   ├── README.md            # Overview, links to architecture/api/

CONTRIBUTING.md              # Contribution guidelines
CHANGELOG.md                 # Version history

```

> **Note**: Use links (`[See Architecture](../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)`) instead of duplicating content.

> **`docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md` is not ours to manage.** `/discover` writes it and **8 commands read it** — `/spec` REVERSE and `/arch` reverse **STOP** when it is missing. `/docs` may cite and link it; never edit, move, rename, or delete it, and never "tidy it away" for not matching the structure above.

### Phase 4: API Documentation

#### Option A: Auto-generate from OpenAPI
```bash
# Generate from openapi.yaml using Swashbuckle
dotnet build
# Swagger UI available at /swagger

# Export OpenAPI spec
curl http://localhost:5000/swagger/v1/swagger.json > docs/api/openapi.json

# Generate static docs
npx @redocly/cli build-docs docs/api/openapi.json -o docs/api/index.html
```

#### Option B: Manual Documentation
```markdown
# API Reference

## Authentication

### POST /api/v1/auth/login

Login and receive access token.

**Request Body:**
\`\`\`json
{
  "email": "user@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
\`\`\`

**Response (200):**
\`\`\`json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "accessToken": "eyJhbG...",
    "refreshToken": "eyJhbG...",
    "expiresIn": 900
  }
}
\`\`\`

**Errors:**
| Code | Message |
|------|---------|
| 401 | Invalid credentials |
| 400 | Validation failed |
```

### Phase 6: Deployment Guide Template

> **Template — example only.** Replace topology, env vars, and observability surface with the project's actual setup. If a component is intentionally absent per an ADR (e.g., no Prometheus per its Rejection ADR, no Kubernetes for MVP), state that explicitly with the actual ADR reference — don't carry forward placeholder sections.

```markdown
# Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites

- Docker 24+
- SQL Server 2022+
- Redis 7+
- .NET 8 SDK (for manual deploy)

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT | Environment | Yes | Development |
| ConnectionStrings__DefaultConnection | SQL Server connection | Yes | - |
| ConnectionStrings__Redis | Redis connection | Yes | - |
| Jwt__Secret | JWT signing secret | Yes | - |
| Jwt__Issuer | JWT issuer | Yes | - |
| Jwt__Audience | JWT audience | Yes | - |

## Docker Deployment

\`\`\`bash
# Build (tag with semver — never deploy :latest beyond a dev laptop, see /deploy)
export VERSION="v1.0.0"
IMAGE_TAG=${VERSION} docker compose build    # honors the compose `image:` key — same canonical path as deploy.md Step 2

# Run (docker-compose.deploy.yml lives at repo root, alongside docker-compose.yml)
IMAGE_TAG=${VERSION} docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.deploy.yml up -d
\`\`\`

## Manual Deployment

\`\`\`bash
# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Build release
dotnet publish -c Release -o ./publish

# Run migrations — generate idempotent script, review, then apply (never `database update` straight to prod)
dotnet ef migrations script --idempotent --project src/MyApp.Infrastructure -o migrate.sql
# review migrate.sql → apply via DB tooling / CI

# Start
dotnet ./publish/MyApp.Api.dll
\`\`\`

## Health Checks

- `GET /health` — Basic liveness
- `GET /health/ready` — Readiness (DB, Redis connected)
- `GET /health/live` — Liveness probe

## Monitoring

- Metrics: `GET /metrics` (Prometheus format via OpenTelemetry)
- Logs: stdout in JSON format (Serilog)
- Tracing: OpenTelemetry → Jaeger
```

## Quality Gate 10 — Documentation Checklist

> Per CLAUDE.md §Quality Gates, `/docs` is an **optional** pipeline step (Legend: `*`). If run, the checklist below must pass before `/verify` / `/deploy`.

Run the §Orchestrator disk-check (below) first, then review. Before proceeding to `/deploy`:

> **Incremental run:** items already satisfied by a prior `/docs` run stay checked if still accurate; only re-verify the docs the change touched. The link-check + no-duplication (Integrity) below run over the **whole** set regardless — so integrity holds even when only part was regenerated.

### Audit (Phase 0)
- [ ] Reviewed `specs/SPEC.md` for features list
- [ ] Checked `architecture/` for design docs and ADRs
- [ ] Verified API contracts in `architecture/api/`
- [ ] Located security docs in `security/`
- [ ] Reviewed `docker/` for deployment info

### README.md
- [ ] Project description
- [ ] Features list
- [ ] Tech stack
- [ ] Quick start instructions
- [ ] Links to detailed docs
- [ ] License

### API Docs
- [ ] All endpoints documented
- [ ] Request/response examples
- [ ] Error codes explained
- [ ] Authentication explained

### Guides
- [ ] Getting started guide
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] Configuration reference
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] **Observability surface declared** — what IS enabled (e.g., Serilog console JSON, `/health`) AND what is NOT (e.g., no Prometheus/Jaeger per ADR-xxx). On-call must not have to guess.

### Meta
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md
- [ ] LICENSE — never invent one (the license is the user's legal decision); absent → return early / record an Open item for the user

### Integrity
- [ ] **No broken internal links** — verify with `markdown-link-check '**/*.md'` or `lychee docs/ *.md` (exit code 0 = clean)
- [ ] **No duplication** — each fact lives in exactly one canonical place; other docs link to it
- [ ] **Output-style conformance** (`rules/output-style.md`) — each doc opens with a plain-language summary (what / why / for-whom); register matches its reader (getting-started/api = newcomer/dev; deployment/troubleshooting = operator, step-by-step); jargon defined on first use
- [ ] Existing root `README.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` preserved if framework-level (see Phase 0 last row)

### Orchestrator disk-check (run BEFORE presenting for Gate 10 review)

A sub-agent's "done" report is NOT ground truth — same discipline as `CLAUDE.md` §Verification After Delegation, applied at artifact level (mechanical invariants only; prose quality stays with the reviewer):

- [ ] **Gate-10 minimum exists** — `README.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/api/`, `docs/deployment.md` on disk; `docs/README.md` hub present with its Audience column.
- [ ] **Run the link check yourself** — `lychee docs/ *.md` (or `markdown-link-check '**/*.md'`) exits 0 over the **whole** set (per the Integrity note — even on an incremental run); don't trust the report's "no broken links".
- [ ] **Preserve check** — if Phase 0 marked the root `README.md` / `CHANGELOG.md` as framework-level, `git diff` shows them untouched; and `docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md`, if it existed before this run, is **byte-identical** (`git diff --quiet -- docs/CODEBASE_MAP.md`) — it belongs to `/discover` and 8 commands read it.
- [ ] **CHANGELOG entry** — this change-set has a row (incremental runs especially).
- [ ] **No template residue** — no `[…]` placeholders and no carried-forward aspirational components (e.g. a Tech-Stack line for a component the Rejection ADR excluded).

Any mismatch → fix on disk first.

## Auto-Generation Tools

```bash
# Generate XML documentation
dotnet build /p:GenerateDocumentationFile=true

# DocFX for .NET documentation
dotnet tool install -g docfx
docfx init -q
docfx docfx.json --serve

# Swagger/OpenAPI export
# Built-in via Swashbuckle.AspNetCore
```

## Agent

Invoke: **Technical Writer**

**Phase ownership** — the Technical Writer sub-agent cannot converse with the user: a missing `LICENSE` (choosing a license is the user's **legal** decision — never generate one, not even "MIT by default"), or an overwrite conflict the Phase-0 PRESERVE rule doesn't already resolve → **return early** with the item instead of deciding alone. The orchestrator obtains the decision, runs the Gate 10 disk-check, and presents the docs for review in the main loop.

```text
"As Technical Writer, generate documentation for the project.
Output language: <Output Language from Project Profile> for prose/artifacts, English for code and technical identifiers
(see .claude/CLAUDE.md → Output Language).
Output clarity: follow rules/output-style.md — audience-first, plain-language summary, register per reader."
```

## Next Step

After documentation complete, run `/verify` (Gate 11 — **step optional · BLOCKING if run**; required inside `/hotfix` — exercise every feature against the real deployed artifact), then `/deploy` to promote (with the verified digest if `/verify` was run).
