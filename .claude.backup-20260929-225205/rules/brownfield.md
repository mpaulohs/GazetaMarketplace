# Brownfield Rules — Working on Legacy Code

> **Summary:** A discipline set that is **mandatory when modifying code that is running / already released** (`Project Profile → Mode: brownfield`). The number-one constraint shifts from *"what am I building"* (greenfield) to **"I must NOT break anything"** — so every principle below revolves around **building a safety net before touching the code**. **Greenfield skips this entire file.**

## Definition

**Legacy code** = code that is running / already released but **lacking tests, spec, or documentation** describing intent. The core problem is not "old code" but **the lack of a safety net to change with confidence**.

---

## 4 core principles

### 1. Measure vs Verify — draw the distinction

**Meaning:** the same command may be *measuring the current state* (measure) or *verifying against requirements* (verify) — only "verify" needs a spec. Draw the distinction so you don't go checking "right/wrong" when there is not yet a spec defining what "right" is.

| Activity | Needs spec? | Belongs to phase |
|-----------|:---------:|-----------------|
| **Measure** — measure the current state (existing coverage, does the suite pass?, complexity, vuln) | ❌ No | Discovery (read-only) |
| **Verify** — check behavior matches acceptance criteria | ✅ Yes | Per-change (after there is a spec) |

> **Consequence:** any step that involves acceptance criteria (`/test` verify, `/review` Correctness axis) **cannot come before reverse-`/spec`** — with no spec there is no "right" to check against. Discovery only *measures*; *verify* is for per-change.

### 2. Upfront vs Per-change — don't do it in bulk upfront

**Meaning:** *one-time* work (code map, baseline) is done at Discovery; *per-change* work is done only for **exactly the area being touched** — do not retrofit the whole repo.

| Done once upfront (Discovery) | Done per-change (flow B) |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Codebase map (`/discover`) | Characterization test for **exactly the area about to be touched** |
| Baseline spec/arch (reverse) | Full `/review` Five-Axis for **the slice I'm modifying** |
| Light health snapshot + red-flag | `/test` verify for the specific change |

> Don't write characterization tests for the whole codebase, don't review the whole repo — only for the area the change touches.
>
> **WRITE per delta — RUN everything:** the rule above only limits the *newly written* part (test, characterization, review effort); the suite/verify-suite that is **already automated** is RUN in full every round — only a green regression net proves the unchanged part is not affected. Lookup table for `/test` · `/review` · `/verify` + decision tree for 9 situations: [`../references/brownfield-pipeline.md`](../references/brownfield-pipeline.md) §Scope per-change.

### 3. Backward compatibility by default

**Meaning:** by default **do not break** what clients / data / integrated systems rely on.

- API contract, response shape, DB schema, event/message format, public behavior **must not be broken** unless there is an ADR + migration plan.
- Breaking changes → bump major version + deprecation window + migration path.
- Every brownfield PR must be able to answer: *"does this change break a running client/data/integration?"*

### 4. Only an ADR authorizes changing the architecture

**Meaning:** only change the architecture when there is an **ADR** (Architecture Decision Record) — don't change it "on a whim" while doing other work.

- Development / feature-modification flows (B1, B2): **keep the architecture unchanged** — `/arch` in conformance-gate mode.
- Only the upgrade flow (B5) may change the architecture, **requiring an ADR** (with a v2-trigger) + migration plan.
- Don't change patterns/structure "on a whim" while doing other work.

## Characterization Test — the central technique

> **Definition:** a test that captures the **current behavior of the code** (not the behavior that is *correct* per spec), serving as a safety net before modifying. It's needed because legacy usually lacks both tests and spec — you must know "what the code *is* doing" to be able to distinguish an intentional change vs an accidental regression.

Different from greenfield TDD:

| | Greenfield TDD | Characterization (brownfield) |
|---|----------------|-------------------------------|
| Test written to | describe the **desired** behavior | capture the **existing** behavior (even when wrong) |
| Initial state | RED (fail, no code yet) | GREEN (pass, code already running) |
| Purpose | drive implementation | detect regression when modifying |

### Procedure when modifying legacy code without tests

```
1. Write a characterization test capturing the CURRENT behavior of the area about to be modified → run PASS (confirm the net is correct)
2. Make the change
3. The characterization test FAILs exactly where behavior changed → review: is this change INTENTIONAL?
   - Intentional → update the test to the new behavior (this is the part allowed to change)
   - Unintended → a regression has been caught, fix it back
4. Behavior not meant to change → the test still PASSes (the net stays intact)
```

### Seams (cut points to test hard-to-test code)

**Seam** = a place where you can change behavior **without modifying the code at that spot**. Legacy usually has hard dependencies (direct `new`, static call, no DI) → you need a seam to make it testable **without changing behavior**:

- Create a seam by: extract interface, virtual method, parameterize constructor.
- Prefer the lowest-risk seam; record it if you must refactor to create a seam — this is the **only exception** to "no gratuitous refactor", and it **must be surrounded by a characterization test first**.

## Strangler-Fig — replace gradually (for B5)

**Strangler-fig** = replace **gradually**, not a one-shot rewrite (big-bang):

1. Stand up the new implementation **in parallel** behind an abstraction/interface.
2. Route a portion of traffic/calls through the new version (feature-flag).
3. Measure, expand gradually; the old version shrinks until it can be removed.
4. Backward-compat throughout — cache miss / new path errors → fallthrough to the old version.

> Example: `ICacheService` is designed from day one (recorded via an ADR when running `/arch`) so that Redis can later be plugged in without touching callers — that is a seam for strangler-fig.

---

## No Gratuitous Refactor

Only refactor **within the scope being touched**, serving the current change:

- Do not "clean up" unrelated code in the same PR (it breaks review + increases regression risk).
- Tech debt discovered → record it per [`principles-and-practices.md`](principles-and-practices.md) §2.5 *Where an out-of-scope finding is recorded* (tech debt → `plans/BACKLOG.md`), then handle it in a separate `/simplify`; don't fold it into the feature/fix.
- Exception: minimal seam-creating refactor to make the code about to be modified testable — must have a characterization test first.

---

## Links with Project Profile & commands

- **Project Profile** (file `.claude/PROJECT_PROFILE.md` — resolution rule: `CLAUDE.md` §Project Mode & Profile) declares `Mode`, `Database`, `Observability`, `Structure`. This rule is only active when `Mode: brownfield`.
- Peripheral technologies differing from the default (Oracle/MySQL/ELK…) → follow `rules/overrides/*` that the Profile declares.
- `/spec`, `/arch`, `/plan` read the Mode to switch behavior (see §Brownfield Mode in each command).

### `/arch` role by flow (summary)

| Flow | `/arch` mode | Default |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Discovery (Phase A) | **reverse** | describe as-is + ADR inferred |
| B1 new feature / B2 modify feature | **conformance-gate** | keep the architecture unchanged |
| B5 upgrade | **redesign** | change with ADR + migration |

## Brownfield checklist (every flow B)

- [ ] There is already a baseline `specs/` + `architecture/` (from Discovery) to reference
- [ ] The area about to be modified: if it has no tests → **write a characterization test first** (capture current behavior, PASS)
- [ ] The area being modified calls DB-resident logic (stored procedure / trigger / DB function) → its defining DDL exists in the repo (snapshot committed — any path, indexed by `CODEBASE_MAP.md` §DB-object inventory) **BEFORE** modifying, and the characterization test covers that object's behavior (fixture applies the repo DDL into the TestContainer — `testing.md` §Template B)
- [ ] The area being modified produces/consumes a message or shares a cache structure → its schema/key definition exists in the repo (serialized class, exported `.avsc`/`.proto`, key-pattern doc — indexed by `CODEBASE_MAP.md` §Messaging/Cache inventories) **BEFORE** modifying; characterization covers the observable effect through a TestContainers-backed broker/cache (never the real one), and the change does not break the schema/key contract other systems rely on (backward-compat by default)
- [ ] Before `/test`: every external registration in the legacy composition root (`Program.cs` DI, `IHostedService` consumers, auto-migrate at startup) is replaced/disabled **inside the test fixture, runtime-only** — real connection strings appear in NO test execution path, and no production config file is edited to make tests pass (`git status` after the suite: `appsettings*.json` / `Program.cs` / `docker-compose*.yml` unchanged → the artifact ships with its original connections)
- [ ] The change alters the schema or a DB-resident object (column/table/proc/trigger/view) → (i) it is authored as a **versioned migration script in the repo** — never edited straight into the database (`database.md` §DB-resident objects are source code); (ii) **`db/schema-snapshot/` is refreshed in the SAME change-set** — re-export from the `/test` TestContainer once the migration has been applied there (that container IS the target state, so no real database is touched) and commit it, otherwise the baseline evidence silently rots from the first change onward; (iii) the system is live → **expand-contract** (`database.md`), not an in-place rename/drop
- [ ] The change **does not break** a running API/contract/schema/behavior (or has an ADR + migration)
- [ ] `/arch` conformance-gate confirms **no architecture change is needed** (B1/B2), or there is an ADR (B5)
- [ ] No refactoring of code outside the scope being touched
- [ ] Migration with **backfill/computed logic** → follow `testing.md §Dual-Implementation Parity`: prefer backfill that **calls the app code itself**; if reimplementing in SQL → **differential test** enumerating enough input classes (a per-side test where both sides are green is NOT enough — drift still slips through)
- [ ] Old tests still PASS (regression net kept intact) + new tests for the change
- [ ] `/verify` proves it on the real artifact before promote (Gate 11)
